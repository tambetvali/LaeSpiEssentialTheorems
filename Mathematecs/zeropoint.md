# The Zero Point of Logic and Reaction

*You can notice this as a side-consideration, rather than a theorem; applied logic cannot work without a reactor and so you have to know it.*

Notice the active cell of math is not a logical relation alone, but combined with reaction space.

In logical space, you resolve the current condition - in reaction space, the possible change.

To meet any condition, your answer must achieve it also in reaction space.

This means, the active cell:
- Normalized logic and reaction space, mostly having them "on the same line" or "R=T", where R is reaction and T is logic. They are aligned so that each equal outcome also yields the same equation, and only their frequency separates them.

For example, direction A as constant is coming from minus space with certain speed and acceleration; but solution A to choose the constant value will enforce your whole response to certain speed and acceleration. In it's own, it might become B slowly, but as you see it as a solution - very fast. Past approaches when you do it earlier, and future as you get it done earlier, but you have to consider it all from logic to reaction to get a single value.

The problem appears most visibly where you do not know whether the given state A=0, or your chosen state A=0, are equal - in the ponegation of imperfection. In perfect logic space, they would be equal right from start, but this does not contradict with need to make them equal: in reality, you often check your reactions with actual outcomes, while the logic is built rather on somehow pre-synchronized space, and thus you typically get a sharp distinction between the two; whatever values you choose your system starts moving somewhere as a whole.

A spacemap of the problem appears: for given logical point, there is the past progress and the future progress. This means the moment, rather than being one single state, is a point with acceleration factor - most simply, from the past to the future moment, or from half of the past moment to half of the future moment; then, this point has a curve inside to exist at all. The past can be deep meaning, while the future is it's flow in an actual world, where it can cease to be what it is - in all these cases, you fall into paradoxes if you don't resolve this condition.

This is also expressed with particular examples in some of the texts.
