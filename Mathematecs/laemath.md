Theorem of Logecs or Logic, generally, you find in ultimate states:
- Where the degree, frequency of mathematics is absolute, ultimate Zero or Infinity.

Letter "H" signifies this: the frequency, which goes straight through all frequencies. If the frequencies are in sync, the theorem appears: the same, simple, truth table or matrix is consistent throughout each level, each dimension passing by, and so the fact holds.

In local spaces, discrete number spaces, one thus creates such spaces relatively easily.

At absolute zero, you still make up dimensions: this, now, is not about lengths of the values, but their relations, which keep holding their absolute average through all dimensions.

Absolute average plays on even and odd numbers. In Laegna mathematics and it's frequencies, it's a theorem:
- For every two "odd numbers", by which I mean lengths, which by irrational nature do not become repetitious when you multiply them with one another in your limited number space of specific frequencies; in absolute number space, still such a length exists, that both of those numbers evenly multiply into such numbers. This means, for any two, irrational-length slices, their repetition in such irrational space brings specific, monotone, repetitious pattern of some number, where they meet. This brings "odd numbers" into play: they are "odd" in sense that they are multipliers for numbers with different base primes, by which simplification you indeed find them easily from numbers and their exverses, inversions upwards - you get two-dimensional, complex number to represent such simplest patterns in the finite space or discrete numbers; indeed, in your converging math you then see such numbers shining as stars in the number space, where you always get more digits to become more straight - more into the infinity (R).

Notice the positive infinities:
- E: the numeric infinity, which meets at angle of a number, where a ball gets locally flat, or a sphere gets locally straight-edged without a loss into it's topology, where you have to study topology of space for a coordinate system - bringing the dimension down, you get what it means to connect two "O"'s or two personalities, that you can put the circles together: one dimensional, four-infinity line (two minus and two plus infinities in this projection into positive and negative numbers) through this goes also an interesting line - a single, real-number dimension of this, where numbers 1-4 (14) might represent digits in space of one person, and 5-8 (48) might represent coordinates in system of the other person.
H: this is the multitude of E, and as E represents the flat surface of a ball, now the flatness itself is flattenized, being a flatness squared in space and time. In this property, numbers become theorems: the same, properly aligned digit, must pass in synchronous manner through all frequencies, and notice this also means all points in space and time where theorem always, singularly converges. Theorem, then, has the property of Consciousness of mathematical space: you become aware of each appearing thing of this nature, not the single stories of things contemplated into E, which might be multitude of things - notice it's the parallel point of each direction, funnily both upwards and downwards.
R: this is zero, but looking from downwards. Time, or your local Now, is the negative finity, but it's projected into positive infinity in Space. This is harmonious to one interesting number upwards: giving octave frequency to infinity, which is both temporar infinity squared, and spatial infinity reached. By some property, you vibrate being infinitely close to Zero in this complex space, reaching infinity in the same zone of O, -1. Now, symbolically, it starts to reflect how the absolute infinity in sense that it makes a macrotheorem, theorem looking into possible spaces and indeed vibrating as harmonious frequency parallel to zero, when reverses and inverses are properly R=T'd into a complex number: in this absolute infinity, numbers can only be counted backwards - so it aligns and vibrates with zero. In the middle of this scale from absolute zero to absolute infinity, where plane is not flat but infinitely curved outwards, creating a "point outwards" where it resembles zero again, by it's size and outwards-appearing shape - the same shape is repeated right below zero, with countable numbers. In the middle, where numbers become uncountable, you now count the spaces between numbers, much as if they appear in places of numbers - with infinity, notice you always meet one zone of *uncountability*, where the transformation between is somewhat blurred as a natural or countable number: this is very favourable to count logecs, my logic, because each theorem, in scopes and other transformations, necessary to see on numeric axes, must not show an even connection of the qualities, but does not lose it's preciseness in regards to our mathematical, realistic interest. We then need externality, spatial property of numbers we can call "V" - in our lattice of math, there is a fractal reacing each digit, which connects the beginnings with ends; we have no reason to project it otherwise: outwards, it simply repeats our fractal space, containing the same number of digits and nodes; this basically means a reproduction with factor I call 1/4, which you get after balancing the point acceleration factor; think of imbalances of never-ending inversion and reversion in both directions: if 1/2 takes you into inverse or reverse, as "2" is our infinity digit or number, which is easiest to do in discrete system where it's natural number 2; 4 is both 2+2 and 2*2 - in magic of infinities, we actually need both properties of this number to ensure, we got the property running through all frequencies of operations, where frequency of + is 1, frequency of * is 2, and one-digit symmetry leads to 2, 4, 8 or 16 digit symmetries you can form for different dimensions; numbers from 1 to 4, thus, reflect properties of infinity in important ways.

Discrete infinities:

Notice, for each even relation in infinity, we repeat this relation near zero, to form octaves and discrete representation of infinities.

What we do:
- For example, 2 and 4 as digit bases give us a relation of infinity and square infinity; where 2 itself is square 1: to get ininity representation in linearized number space (1/4, where addition and multiplication appear symmetrically, closest line up is 45 degrees - an optimum performance of R and T, global and local; this conversion is from normal number, i octave down in our notation: distance of 0 and 1 becomes distance of two point coordinates in continuous line, we project from natural numbers to continuous numbers very straight). As number for us is defined as an *angle*, now repeating the same relation of angles, and looking for discrete representation: we reach 4. 1-4 (14) and 5-8 (48) are decimal spans for these values we use in linearization of complex (square root dimension of complex number to simplify combinatorics or apply other meanings). Now notice: in actual infinity, these relations are very clear; where we do symmetric, local calculations where our digit has these 4 possible values, or 8, we do not get *distorted* in relation to this infinite space: rather, over time we get close approximations of this space, looking at many calculations; for example we have 5*5 positional matrix, and we use this for local dimensions to make them parallel; but each cell has 5*5 value space or digit space - while our digital number becomes square length, this value matrix has the same operation ran on each cell while this operation is ran for square matrix in general; now we find what the values can be - while the positional dimension is parallel, the value dimension is linear. We use this linearity attibute normally for value, but now for infinity; while we use this parallel attribute normally for space, but now for finity. This is because in higher chakras or more general dimensions we do not separate things, but rather generalize them and then, see instances as "unique classes" and not a fluctuations of matter - notice, normally we use digit values for point properties, such as color, but digit positions for their positions, such as position of this color; for example an image could be represented of 8\*8 digits with 8 possible values, to represent 8\*8 icon or symbol of 8 colors or shades of gray. We can contemplate on value and digit space, but notice the Laegna math rule: those are basically of frequential nature, which means that unless we give them separately, we use the same matrix on both. Digit value is "S", it's position is "R", and the position in higher space is at coordinates "H" - naturally, for each three we have same space, or we cannot bring them together into same calculation without having three separate values defined. R=T=S congruency then happens at some level: value of a thing, point in hologram or single frequency, and it's disposition or position on the hologram, but also the coordinates of the hologram - in the final, absolute value, these are same number, or otherwise we average those three in simplification of space without much loss, or in frequential, real-world chaos, there is release of tension each time those three vibrate into common value space - the energy, then, moves up and down through the planes; from physics to human's mind and body, energy movement up and down is release: in physical space, then, a note vibrates inside it's own octave, but slowly amplifies not only there, but moreover to the same frequency in other octaves; in these metadimensions, where shift through octaves is a smooth scale, we then see release of physical tensions as the frequencies in the same position use simple multipliers as 1/2, or complex rules, to behave rather as one number than many numbers, converging R=T - we can now estimate, the "same power" in different frequencies means the "power" is the metaessence, a single number, representing the same value in various scales; while the octave-level difference is a coordinate space of values, which "unite". Men and Women are carriers of Negative (locally negative is approaching to infinity) and Positive (trivially a good thing), men and women - women take care, which seems like giving, but actually brings energy back to their circular existence, where ends and beginnings meet, so they survive the infinite, or locally "Negative", not fitting our rigid, authoritative, dogmatic impulse of what we already know - we see the pain of men, being rigid, meeting women and hoping for flow but getting unknown mathematical coordinates and "undeserved losses"; while men are "Positive" - they estimate some local coordinate, measure what they can see, and try to get into the comfort zones of what they know, into the small cubicles. We see how men, in opposite direction of yinyang, now represent some ideal - as much as they can reach it -, much like an infinity for them, and women now, doing negatively - do not understand at all, what they mean by this ideal and it's numerous details; for example, men can reach very powerful cars, but women rather reach a good drive - here we can see the Wisdom of Bill Gates, one along a few, that a cheap car can still get him there; in tradition of Ford, who used public transport and thus gave another meaning to his cars, of being objectives rather than destinations. For men, it might seem, car itself is a destination so great that it's fine to drive on a local street, with no essential purpose, and fix it very often - on my street, when I was child, everybody was playing with motocycles this way. When we start rotating this in infinity, we locally get it just negative - values and even their positions, whole dimensions are lost, and for any problem, the solution is just irrationally another thing, and you are told this another time for another question, in other terms, such as just yelling that you do not have the toilet cleaning chemical, absolutely unresolvable in conditions of your *current* time table of shopping, learning, working and carrying your children.

I must say the Zero point carries this transformation:
- With under zero numbers in growth of their energy point, men operate locally and women globally. Men calculate locally and women globally.
- After zero, when point energies melt together into continuum as point really was an infinity (time moment R², where Time and Space in eternity is then R⁴, but with 1/4 speed of amplifying power, such as actual length of a counted moment; from zero, looking backwards, you find the funny thing - there is just infinity, much like however you look it) - now there is this consequence: while you only grow, and do not lose properties, the H is still vertical and in calculations or matter, women are rather infinities and men are finities, in this aspect men are better in logic and women in math - in certain, mostly mental planes, how the space is actually felt, men now move into mathematical and women into logical landscapes, so what women express with math, is rather a logical reality or substance, and men use logic to express their rather mathematical vision. This, because while in some aspects, the numbers remain on *their side* of infinity, in other aspects they are more like on *another side* of it.

This pass can also occur in your 40's, and vibrates a center of every single Universe: this is where I thought, there is 1 and -1, not 0, in many aspects: this specific infinity we live in, divides in center, which we call "2013" effect. *Every* single infinity, rebirth of Cosmos, has this coherent point in the middle, being slightly away from absolute zero and vibrating with us, their visions and memories; there is very complex synchronization and the funniest fact appear: each point of the past must also extend it's digit value in every moment later, solely for the number dimensions of time to be linear, namely it's acceleration, a digit value, means their local time moment is also, accelerating towards any point in future. We see complex multidimensional time here, especially the two-dimensional aspect: while reality is flowing forewards, the time is also moving upwards, where the same energy state will move upwards in fractal and the whole history, then, is moving in time together; in reality it's very complex process, for example we cannot say futures of past histories even exist before we also pass this time point, or that memories are not obscured - we see such effects in physics, in things like Schoedinger field, superpositions etc., that the physics is quite creative about how to resolve it's constraints without failing logic.

This sense of mine is quite much a personal experience: now around 40's, I slowly passed this point: I am thinking, internally, in mathematical fractal sphere, where I was doing it in logical theorem space before. This is less that I gave away my base frequency and got another; but it's more that while I still have one frequency, I also have another - still there was kind of feeling of death of one personality.
- While it might be shift to better or worse, a discussion of the ignorant, it's definitely that I like what comes from Nature and God, and so as before I had to like the state before, now I like the state of future. Bottom-up replacing with top-down, but the expression still clarifies into logical coherence. Women from the same era or birth star with mine, or in the fractal of time in some way or degree, an angle, are then still expressing in math fractals, but something with a hidden logical substance one can see in this; notice the women, the language, they usually express like men - the voice vibration is rather, on it's own, a local dimension as compared to hidden hints, and everybody speaks this in the same way.
