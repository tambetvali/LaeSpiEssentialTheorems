# Curvature of Mathematical Space

The mathematical space seems to be symmetric, but is actually *curved* and *velocity-acceleration* system.

The case that is can be accelerative is the case where variables empower each others; before-an-operation and after-an-operation states differ in their relations so that I and E appear: after an operation, the past value affects itself, and the future value also differs in pre-operations state, in the new metasystem, from what caused it. This forms a mathematical inertial system, and what I call "mathematical physics" - the same time math is going on, different forces apply to it and it can easily be wrecked, taken off-course, or be lucky. This system, to be analyzed, needs to be seen as additional axes of Time added: possibly a mathematical Time, which exists in realm of causes and effects all throughout your system.

The physical system is not metaphysical, and the causes and effects do not appear directly, but through calculations of the process - even in our Mind, for it's experience, it benefits from seeing causes and effects, not only intuitively guessing them; while intuition gets sharper by experience, constant experience is needed to feed this process. We need to look at *knowledge as energy* - what is the actual framework or process, where Truth is converging into Power, where are the *nerves triggered with energy* so that *they could affect the muscles*. Very often, we have a little feeling of danger or opportunity, but the process is not charged: we can long follow a habitual path. Zen and Tao, when the senses and decisions flow from this major scale, to this minor scale - from this higher octave to this lower octave, here-reality. Higher octave is "higher" mostly by being repeated on this lower scale, or it can be seen that: creativity will enchange our causes and effects, even the true potential of us in the past for those, who helped us and received our help; so, where our Reason stays intact, for example we sleep, eat and walk and talk, but the Reality of this reason will Rise, taking all the time from beginning to end with it - each has a little bit bigger interest. Acceleration and decceleration, then, is like rising above the time and space and moving it all in one unit, where just movement with different speeds seems like being statically still, explainable by non-linear logic, so that the time is neither rising or going down.

Curved space is such:
- The reason of A is implication of B.
- The reason of B is implication of A.

This is a two-dimensional time, with root and crown chakra synchronization: from-past and to-future, in these math chakras, appear consequentively. While we cannot imply A into this system of B, or B into this system of A: we have to model freedom in time and space into mathematics, and the variables, which would be affected by different ponegations, interactions of these binary systems. In our model world, different parameters of how B and A behave in regards to each others, in two-dimensional mathematical time, and one dimension of actual time, which would be affected *in it's complete state*. We also measure the wrong measurements and variables, which are left open. From this simulation, we get an interaction of A and B, but we must show this in *curved space* - while the variables interact, the whole system is either accelerating or deccelerating, or keeping a static velocity; as we scroll down the system in accelerated space, and rotate it so that unknowns disappear and odd points of actual value relations remain: now we can generate a test space, a testification system, which can do a Sinus effect of providing this space with different guesses, running different more or less safe trials, such as whether you would lose this money on stock market, earning back what you lost by having this result in relation to not having it. These trials, then, fill the variable space of given interactions, which appear now in O and A (one and other variable) relation in terms of I and E (the space of these variables, relating themselves with others); for both variables to be 4-state, two bits or digits might be used in each case, but naturally the symmetric system is *a little* more complex.

What is curved?

Linear, straight system does not produce effects into it's inputs, as it resolves it's outputs. Curved, non-linear system has future and past perspectives, or me and you perspectives, where the value of the past is different as seen from the future and past, and the value of future is different from perspectives of future and past. Two-variable binary systems are indeed the most trivial, first tables we would ever resolve:
- From this solution we see that we cannot measure singular systems by logic. Instead, we create a two-variable dependent complex, and use U-notation or leave open the variables, then philosophically transcend the coordinate system, just as Deep Learning algorithm might work for us, creating such transformation matrix where we feed the system back to itself to transcend it. Most of the physics is transcended in such way, as you can see in my text about Laegna, the classical philosophy part, the portal or main page of Notion.so page for Laegna, my mathematics and logical-linguistical system. This does not resolve into our space with limited dimensions: the points we seek are "odd", and they do not provide repetitive, linear system for us: instead, within higher dimensions any non-symmetric pattern can be seen on acceleration and decceleration basis, which provides local variable structures based on their variables and unknowns of such force.
- We do not answer philosophical systems, such as whether God exists: rather, we resolve all dependent variables, which can be measured and really affect the life; from relations between "what God is" and "does such thing exist", "what God is for us" and "does such thing exist in our lives" etc. we build the system of dependent variables or outer space of those questions: this is then an odd variable space, which projects and interplay inside those questions, and answers our practical needs.
 - The philosophy of this is: if two variables really cannot measured, then the causes and implications could be measured; each one we could measure in *how it relates to God exists and does not exist given this or that God, god or godlike qualities of a person*, the actual pattern starts to appear. There are unknown variables in life, like each of our adventures and changes, each time a space and time is finally resolved, new questions appear and the *Creative Vibe* goes on as a constant - we do not need "precise oracles", but ones, which can interplay in this Empty Space; we are not gaining anything from glimpses to the straight future, because of curved and unfolding nature of all this. For anything we know, we can do better, and for any question answered, we ask more questions - those more questions will raise our time. So for unlimited possibilities, when we promise and goal, we do not pay back and over, and receive back and over, on straight line of time, but in Empty Void of all possibilities, and we interact that *someone pays this* - for example, if we are allowed to live, we live and use that production; when the government bans it illegal for us to live properly, if they do not care about our genius: indeed, we do not leave it *unearned*, but we check the incomes of soldiers, warriors, advocates - we might earn much better by proving to society, or over it's head to the Nature, it's not able to earn this money; from figuring out all the money people trashed, and all the gains they still get, our work is not over - but even more complex, expensive and paying-off work goes on; now when we die: a genius dies, but this is bound to bring *a very positive wave to history*, where the value of his work finally starts to vibrate on the potential world, and the *investments and risk-avoidance in these matters*, for whole races and nations, start to pay off this dept: for example, suddenly a civilization is still smiling and happy, but *statistics shows they lost 5 geniuses, for whatever reasons*: this karmic effect is not an indirect punishment and rewards, as we see on initial stock market, where I use variable "nu", a greek letter more or less; but it's the direct karma: this karma is not asking God or anybody to pay or receive - rather, in war, business and other areas, where the men smile, the women see this civilization as a loser; and when the women smile - suddenly, the market buzz around such loss is not a market, but a real bankcrupcy. In these karmic matters we seek the punishment and rewards, and we can fight all these forces - but then, it's not about calculating something, or doing something, but the Satan himself is just standing still here: whatever the ethics and all the buzz, the Satan, one day, does not have money and decent weapons, and starts running all this civilization as an *Evil Circus* - when a *Clown* appears, like a soldier, or as a businessman, or even a president: suddenly they do an emergent joke, and the Wise will start to yiddle and fail not even on their own, but as *nothing wise is Left to Say, but it would appear stupid*.

Mathematical space curvature: we simulate all the variable, cause and implication settings, and we reach a metatime, along with mathematical time; we normalize this to basic dimensions and variables, and identify the variables in degree in which they exist - for example, if this was not this man speeding up our journey, it had to be the other man. As we resolve this curved solution towards optimal solutions or choices: suddenly we know this case that while we do not know the specific variables A and B, we have resolved the tension of A and B up to certain degree, applied this in practice, and thus we used accelerated spaces or creativity to *still solve the A and B*.

For example "whether I am immortal" is up to - what is me, either body, ego, mind, or ripple in a field of life; what is immortal about this - karma, it's essence, it's current rebirth etc. For example, in dreams where I don't remember my everyday reality, am I still me, or is this already another reincarnation?

We answer all these questions and relations, and we resolve in this complex - what matters and what does not. In logex, I use x as in logix, for the automata or machine which will simulate the logical system of smoother and more aligned variables; we get, not only a partial answer, but a machine running trials-and-errors of all those perceived causes and consequences, so that the question melts in this space.
- If this aspect affects your life, probably one day: you can measure it. Because, in this multivariable system: mathematical Faith is rather, that the causes and effects, which are bad if you intented wrong, will appear in your system and as the system stabilized, it will project the answer space of complex, self-determinant and self-dependent variable with several objective and subjective basis.
- If this aspect does not affect your life, you see the Empty Void of existence: the question and answer slowly fade away, they are the Philosophy which asks the same questions, and gives the same and different answers forever; not c.
