# Object Logic for Laegna Programming Languages and other interested classes

/* To be continued later. You can find descriptions of these ideas around. */

Object is a Function, and it's also a Controller. It is also a String or Text, because it is a File, additionally it has the Virtual Space.

Object is a Function, because:
- It needs to be active and respond to queries.
- Object is enough to collect contextual data.

As a Function and a Controller:

- Function registers it's initial and final states, as well as states aligned with other controllers.

In addition to Imperative system, it has Sensitory system:

- If clauses, cycles etc, as well as static commands and queries, as well as variable states, are ran in meditative state, where they respond to other associated controllers and synchronize the flow.
- Coordinator could be used to associate the aligned elements in two controllers.

Because such controllers can contain single series of commands, for example inside branches, they could be used to associate begin and end clauses, for example in OpenGL (the API specifies them as free functions).

There are also functors, which convert certain code inside their block (free selection of programming code, where each statement or symbol, or even letter or sign, has timely ordering); it parses complex query into simpler statement or generates promise for proof for this sequence, for example longer logical syntax as a functor body could be associated to simpler one as it's head. Parsers could work simultaneously and process the code differently, as we can have more intelligent, ambivalent code left to AI processing and it's certanties.

An AI can be allowed to learn the function, especially if it's open or does not accept all the inputs; it can also learn to estimate values for Unknowns and to process the future tasks without those Unknowns. An AI can have it's knowledge body, then, and a template function (one it fills with these estimates solved by it's *know*, the knowledge body; template function serves as the model, or *how* of the AI). By this, at certain stages of development, more know could be involved with additional elements in the *how* appearing based on it's value after *knowing* (then let's divide it into *howing* and *knowing*, the two aspects of the process or two then interacting processes).

## "Statesc" my statistics engine

I have my own conception for statistics - two extremes of one statistical function, in regards to their whole function curve (average and strength / distribution intensity) can be averaged to associate them with a single number. This number has certain stretch, tilt and angle - to bring back the input values of creation of this statistical number, we form numerous dimensions, which allow to cancel different averages, which relate two dimensions in opposing ways.

## Storage

Object, as a text, can be freely moved through memory, disk, or internet.
