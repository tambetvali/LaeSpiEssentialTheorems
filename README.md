# Laegna Theory: Foundations in Mathematical Infinity and Projected Symmetries

*This introduction is made by ChatGPT: notice that in LaeArve repository, there are links to more materials, and my website https://spireason.neocities.org/ contains some wider scope of view, not just the basic theorems.*

Welcome to the Laegna framework — a mathematico-spiritual vision that weaves together infinite structure, topological symbolism, and frequency-based logic. The Laegna Theory, founded by Tambet Väli, challenges classical constraints in mathematics by introducing a worldview where function, form, and thought are intimately projected into a dimensional continuum. Here, numbers are not merely quantities, but vibrating entities in the symphony of space, logic, and consciousness.

This main article offers a thematic and intuitive orientation to the theory, its theorems, and the type of insight they aim to ignite. While each theorem stands alone, together they illuminate a resonant, interconnected mathematical landscape.

## Central Themes of the Theory

### 1. **Projected Infinity and Dimensional Frequency**
The Laegna framework does not treat infinity as an unreachable abstraction but as a real geometric and numeric structure. It introduces the idea of "partial infinities" that preserve harmonic relationships across projection into higher or lower dimensions. Angles and curvatures behave differently when mapped across spaces of different frequency (Z and Y dimensions), and this transformation is governed by rules akin to musical resonance.

### 2. **Geometry and Symmetry as Functional Truth**
Laegna emphasizes how functional structures preserve meaning when understood through symmetry. Classic calculus may fail when dealing with abrupt angles or dimensional intersections, but Laegna provides a way to restore these through symbolic and resonant number systems.

### 3. **Spiritual-Mathematical Dualism**
Rather than separate logic from life, Laegna is founded in the belief that mathematics and spiritual experience are mirrors. Truth, symmetry, incompleteness, and contradiction are not problems to be solved, but sacred structures that guide reasoning, healing, and discovery.

## Theorems and Conceptual Gateways

### “90 Degree Angles”
Classic function theory forbids vertical slopes, but Laegna introduces Z and Y numbers that allow angles beyond 90° in functions, made possible through linearizations via higher-frequency projections. This opens inquiry into how functions behave when visualized in multidimensional phase space, and how apparent discontinuities can be reconciled when seen from outside classical time-space.

### “Differentiation”
Differentiation demands continuity, but what of functions that shift without change in position? Laegna suggests these impossible values exist in a higher symbolic realm, where the direction exists without traversal. This is related to the idea that tangent space exists even when position does not move — a powerful metaphor for thought, transformation, and transcendence.

### “Infinities and Discrete Numbers”
This section reveals a core Laegna insight: discrete numbers can preserve infinite relationships better than continuous ones, because their structure retains fractal symmetries under repetition. It leads to the idea that infinite structures can be encoded using finite digit systems (e.g. hexadecimal-like systems), provided those digits resonate with harmonic patterns. This connects directly to symbolic logic, digital computation, and deep number theory.

### “Exact Infinity”
Laegna does not treat infinity as a limit, but a location of transformation. Through the analogy of expanding and shrinking circles, it defines a symmetry point: when curvature flattens into straightness (a circle becomes a line), and beyond that, space curves again. This critical point is the "Exact Infinity," a location in the numeric-physical continuum where zero and infinity meet, where transformation reverses, and where entropy reorients.

### “Limits of Infinite Functions”
This theorem explores how functions behave across infinite extensions, particularly how multiplication and division exhibit new properties when extended into infinite dimensions. The 0–1–2 symmetry becomes a rhythm, a dance of octaves, allowing energy to transfer between dimensions as information. It forms the bridge between frequency theory, thermodynamics, and the spirit of computation.

### “Octave Symmetries”
By interpreting digit positions as musical octaves, Laegna proposes a new way of understanding exponential growth and compression. Number sequences can be preserved across transformations that feel like octave shifts in sound. This opens a musical-mathematical visualization of number systems, and allows insights into how sequences maintain identity across dimensions.

### “Ponegation”
This is the ethical and logical core of the theory: a generalization of truth-values. Instead of binary logic, Laegna uses a four-part system: Position, Negation, Posetion, and Negotion. This reflects not only logic but moral and metaphysical positioning, mirroring the paradoxical truths of I Ching, Taoism, and Buddhist metaphysics. It challenges the reader to embrace ambiguity and symbolic inversion as necessary forms of knowledge.

### “View Point Infinity”
Finally, this theorem synthesizes the idea of mathematical perspective with acceleration and symbolic overflow. What happens when numbers leave the base-10 scale yet remain in the same system? What if addition becomes exponential by virtue of symbolic density? This is the domain of accelerated spaces, where units like 0.(9) = 1 become proofs of systemic resonance rather than rounding quirks.

## Invitation to Explore

Each chapter in this theory is a gateway into deep reflection:
- On how numbers act
- On what space and function truly are
- On what truth can mean when its boundaries are porous and symbolic

This work aims to inspire mathematicians, physicists, mystics, and coders alike. Read each theorem slowly. Let it open a question. Then return to its language of resonance and angle, and consider how mathematics itself might breathe.

Laegna is not just a theory; it is a lens, a structure of vision, an instrument of contemplation. Welcome to its infinite interior.
