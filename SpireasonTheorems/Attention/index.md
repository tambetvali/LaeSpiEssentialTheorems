# Attention

Attention is your Vehicle of Mind to explore the territories of Mental Realms.

The Theorem to Meditate is the following:
- Attention can be used in several ways; either the attention in silence, which seems mystical, or the attention used when you normally live your life. This similarity can make you ponder, why so common force is, in certain context, leaving you so mystical impression.
- Attention uses you mental and physical power regarding to those signals, which are coming in, and all this process is used in creative process. Like logical machine is solving each combination you give it, and reaching truth about this by strict logical rules, but now reaching that with what it does not combine - your Attention is necessarily all that you combine.
- Attention, as you use it, becomes deeper and forms Consciousness: what you, in the first place, are aware of, by will; that general type of consciousness, later, becomes your non-intented part and works even where you don't see.

Through Attention, Awareness and Consciousness you build your mind. Giving the Attention only the basic theorems you can simulate many properties with computer and build Spireason's Theorems.
