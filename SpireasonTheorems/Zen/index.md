You Goal System must be fluid to Reality: you give away what wants to go, you rather do not suspress a good thing when it's coming. You don't force things about future and past, where they are insecure, and you do not behave hopefully and fearfully if the present is not known.

This principle, as it transcends even the most important things in you: is about choices based on reality and can be proven like this.
