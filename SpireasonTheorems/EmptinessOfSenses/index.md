# Emptiness of Senses

Your senses do not directly rely on any particular reality or model of external reality.

Rather, they build up a coherent, symbolic and useful model:
- You might train your intellectual thinking to see proper models associated with each thing.
- Your body complex, where a central system is communicating with many systems, which abstract each, will create you symmetric, meaningful and simplified image.

As such, you cannot verify each thing being symbolically there in your mind to represent reality, to be actually and simply physically present.
