# Karma

Theorem of Karma, much like Christian Ethics or Theory of Business, resolves that energy must reach back to it's beginning.

More Buddhist version would see it in cycles of reality, where the energy would reach back to it's start - both the energy of giving and receiving are important. In Buddhism you often start solving them in particulars.

More Christian version would see it in cycles of the cause or source, such as philosophical reason: for example, energy achieved with Goodness is given back to Goodness; energy achieved via life is given back to life.

Both versions are essentially identical - mathematics is impossible to solve for one, without also proving the other. It can be seen as a system of Punishment and Reward, which makes you run towards certain direction - this is much more visible in practice for Theory of Business. Rather, people are using those theorems to become confident as they build up the Illumination.
