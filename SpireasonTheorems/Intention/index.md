# Good Intent

Instead of doing it all based on your knowledge, you use your intent.

Even for many things you do not know: Intent directs even these unknown territories, just like Game Theory enables your math with missing base data.

Such as building your new powers into unknown territories, you hope that the Intent would align with your instincts, essential understandings, evolutionary developments and many other things - being already a first step there. First, without knowing what: you intent.

To meditate on meaning of Intent: you will see you need to to be master to intent, even if many things coming later expect you much more conscious choices: Attention, Intent and Karma are right there in the beginning, and you can create your Physical and Mental forces based on these assets rather than thinking you would need much more - as more open you are to the results and the way, as more surely these forces would enlighten you in every special case.

Right Words or Right Actions, attributes in list of Buddha, are much more complicated before you have ran around with Right Intent - which is, then, building them up. It's important to notice: with Good Intent, you are already going. Irrationality of life in Material and Intuitive realms would fade away.
