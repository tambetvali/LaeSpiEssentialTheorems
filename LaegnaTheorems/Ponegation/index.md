# Ponegation

There is a theorem of ongoing reality: I call it theorem of Incompleteness or Imperfection. It's my mathematical version of theorem of Dukkha, which holds in life.

By this theorem, "True" and "False" do not make up values themselves, which could decide our calculations, but rather we also need to consider, whether those two are in right places. Fractal of such dispositions follows and they create complex space, which is topologically different - unmatch to very deep level - to that of binary reality.

We can simulate another kind of binary reality on this system and simplify many conceptions to binary truth; very often we use the case that it gives two binary oppositions, which are very often equal.

Ponegation, as it sees some truth as imperfect, becomes a goal-based system resembling life: also it's base number four is highly important, consisting of twos - as a primary digit, two has a symmetry towards logarithms and exponents, which basically gather the incertanty from infinity.

Ponegation values:
- Position: that which is True and should be so.
- Negation: that which is False, but not so importantly.

- Posetion: that which is True, but does not deserve that.
- Negotion: that which is False, but by foolish decisions or the unfortunate.

Ponegation does not fail to give symmetries to Tao, internal and external, and it also fits well to the hexagrams of I Ching - each line is a binary value with it's change, which can be mapped to ponegation. Moreover, similar mysteries to Tao and I Ching, expressions of similar consequences, appear in abstract math - for example, we can see Good in Bad and Bad in Good, rather than some kind of average value of things towards two extremes; we see them still separately and do not find an unifying constraint.
