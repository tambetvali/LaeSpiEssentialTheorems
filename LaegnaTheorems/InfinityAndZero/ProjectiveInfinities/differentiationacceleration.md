# Differentiation

You can see the sharp angles form impossible numbers:
- Function needs a zero-distanced points on function to be directed up or down, while moving up and down without moving further is not possible in finite geometry.

You need Z angles above zero to reach that. You find numerous impossibilities, where you use Z and Y, in regards to projecting between functions: in different reasons of textbook, where the projection is impossible (such as taking an integral or solving a differential equation).

There is important solution through symmetries: where tangent of that value is often possible, the value itself is not. Then, this lack a defined mathematical property.
