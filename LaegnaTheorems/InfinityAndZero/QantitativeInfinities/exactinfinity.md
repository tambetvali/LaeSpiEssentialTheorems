# Exact Infinity

My infinity is not qualitative - meaning it does not end; it is the exact number at where the uncountability would reach it's peak.

This is "Temporal Infinity", not a "Spatial Infinity", in sense it's about the Value, not about it's Position: so it's the T theorem of Infinity.

When you draw a circle:
- Small circle has big angle in each point of it's edge.
- Big circle has small angle in each point of it's edge.

How to measure this?
- Draw big and small circle so that the edges are connected at the same point, and the center of small circle is on the line with this connection point and the center of big circle.

As you make the circle bigger, at one point the line is straight: this is the exact infinity. After this, it is curved in opposite direction: it's in accelerative space with weird properties, i.e. weird properties of physical space in near-infinity by Albert-Einstein, which counts where physical numbers start to approach some limits.

As you make the circle smaller, at some point it does all the 360 degree turn in one point: this is the square root of zero, where you have to distribute the 1d points of zero into 2d square, and now see the edge length to decide the size of this sub-zero point. Then, zero itself is important as well: when time started cold and is warming up, which is one of my ..kind of metaphysics of thought and relations, even if not a theory; think how long it took for this colder time to reach the middle - where the energy heat use factor was near zero, the absolute time passed must reach the middle point in several aspects and paradigms, finally giving a precise mathematical size for this time moment. This energy level rise: commutate with entropy, which makes the space more complex, so that each infinity of combinations also leaps towards kind of "intelligence", and towards intelligence and creativity later: both of which are infinite, never-ending qualities. This "temperature" is basically an effect of useful work: humans and animals, despite they do not have this "higher energy", can live in similar fashion through all these times: physics can create these bodies with legs and hands, even if the density of information, thus the actual benefit of the energy, does not provide so many useful calculations: mentally, a never-ending work is to melt, slowly, the ice bergs, to warm up the Mind. In other end of infinity, it starts rather overheating: the center is like a lighthouse, it radiates the Middle Way in this cold desert of snow and heat. But it's like Earth: people live everywhere and develop different skills. / so much about my mythos

Numbers, now, as they take these curves on circle: you see a symmetric aspect of this point, that it actually will change frequencies and distances between points, something even mathematically hard to explain: this angle is how I define numbers to make sure my number axe continuously flows from zero to infinity. This curve, at infinity, becomes a point length and the number starts to accelerate: this slowing-down, standing-at-correct-speed (the whole middle area of sub-zero and infinity is linear), and it starts to get some reverse elements after the infinity: it actually floats away from this linear number axe, as focus to these points is an impossible number inside the numeric axe, where two lines of an angle cross and meet, which actually are slightly directed apart from each others.

Here you see interesting properties of angles: very thin angles and very wide angles are possible.

To imagine all the logical space, where we operate: to have dimensions, which reflect the logical relations, we already need those infinities and hyperdimensional scales.
