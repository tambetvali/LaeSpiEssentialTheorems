# View Point Infinity

Matrix or Perspective, which creates the symmetries of space for our vision - whether it's parallel, perspective, etc. - would contain sub-zero and infinite zoom levels, planes or spaces as impossible. The way points relate, is impossible.

If we write number 0.(9), with ever-repeating 9 in decimal system, it becomes to mean one, so digits after comma slightly affect digits before comma. But if in the same number system, we locally imagine number 10 as digit, such as A from hexademical number system (of base-16) - still remaining in decimal system, this could easily become impossible.

Now imagine: we can locally say how this number leaves the number scale, and by which factor.

We collect numerous logical errors:
- We seek relations of 0, 1, 2 3 etc. - each relation is affected in infinity by some constant factor of velocity.
- Looking into all operations we do: the formulaes used to calculate such thing, periods of digits after zero, can actually be used to contain bigger digit values without changing the number base: each is a separate variable.
 - Here, we meet a paradox: values of infinities do not reflect this, but instead reach a static constant for all numbers afterwards. We must have exact mathematical relations, which smoothly keep the given rules, but we can easily create mathematical trash here: impossibilities.

Now, we move to accelerated space: exponent factor coordinate space, where each two coordinates in relation to any others are separated by exponent factor space: with this method, the digits with bigger values do not get distorted by mathematics, which creates a coherent body of calculations - we do not have so many operations, like functions of mere multiplications, divisions, sums and subtractions, which lose all their defined relations for factors we have not explicitly expressed. We see that a number, which would never reach in any calculation, is actually much more complex and defined by complex logic, not by random operation in math, which creates any infinity.

This can be see:
- Multiply 1 with 0 and assign this to "A".
- Now divide the "A" with zero.
- You should now have number 1, because this is the variable value of "A".

In Laegna system, number 1 is X1, while "A" equals Z1 - then, multiplication of "A" again, equals X1 and no kinds of magic is introduced to math: there are no numbers where we don't know their fate.

What is accelerated system?

It system, where 1+1 is bigger than 2: the addition of normal frequency already has some multidimensionality, and properties which more commonly belong to multiplication or exponential calculations.
