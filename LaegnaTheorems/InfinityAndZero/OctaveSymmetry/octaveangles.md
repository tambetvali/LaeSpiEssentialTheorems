# Octave symmetries

Digits of a number generally have each digit position in comparison to the previous one, growing exponentially.

This digit relation can be changed by octave multipliers: additional exponents can be added, or half exponents, or removed. This is 1, 1/2, 2 etc. exponential factor of change of digit encodings. It is very similar to scientific e factor used in decimal system, and even shares the number "e" in some notations, altough it's a deep dive into numbers "e" and "i".

Notice this: when you remap digits based on octave or half-octave factors, which is parallel to many central math operations, the digit sequence or a very simple projection of it will remain intact. While prefix X, Y, Z is changing, the digit values remain the same.

You can see as you shift numbers: you do accelerated inversation and exversation, turning the function outside-in or inside-out, in both directions; you can here see and this is 1/8 shift, done sometimes by decimal numbers 5 to 8: while digits are running from end to beginning, and from beginning to end, so that the number behaves as wheel, otherwise there is the same sequence of same numbers: the wheel is rotating, but it remains the same wheel with the same order, especially if you imagine the line connected from outside as well.

These properties are important in: visualizing, what happens with your precise numbers in infinity. Meditate on this: Laegna number reflects something deeper than the mere local number value; it also reflects it's relative position in multidimensional world, even in surrealistic dimensions of infinity, denoted by small triangle in same position of a small circle of degree unit.
