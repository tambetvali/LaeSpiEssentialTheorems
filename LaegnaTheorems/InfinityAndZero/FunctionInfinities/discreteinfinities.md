# Infinities and Discrete Numbers

Partial Infinity: partial infinity is such finite number, which creates relations with other finite numbers such that if they are repeated in infinite fractal, those symmetries make sense in infinite space: their local relations will be kept intact. This is the harmonic of two frequencies.

Discrete numbers can map infinite spaces into local space in a way that their relations are linear under different transformations. When repeated infinitely, they appear in infinite space.

Continuous numbers, which directly contain infinities, cannot do that: a matrix, in regards to making it symmetrically smaller or bigger, does not preserve the order of points in projected space.

Discrete space projection of infinities, where Laegna number digit is resonant to this: which means, infinitely long sequences of digits remain with their original symmetries and mathematical relations and theorems are not lost. For example, single "E" digit equals 2, but infinite number of "E" digits might equal infinity depending on coordinate system; relations between digits I, O, A, E: as you extend the number length, the relations in infinity appear the same as the local relations. So they are discrete numbers, where infinity is projected.

This very same way: you keep in decimal system, but you use additional digit values such as 10 and 11 (you can use "A" and "B" from hexadecimal): as discrete number properties remain, they map them in infinite sequences into replication of those properties in infinity.
