# Infinity to relativity

Imagine the bubble of space, our measurable horizon, is the Y-scale infinity, where we live locally in X range of our human and
it's robotic-natural ecosystem. Z scale is the point maximum speed of light.

Y: where we start becoming frontwards flat towards infinity, in theory of relativity, we measure this flatness as forward-angle
of this number of distance (velocity exponent) and velocity (acceleration exponent). This converges into some point we call Y
infinity, where it's angle of linear compression in forward-direction measures it's forward-angle of number, and the infinity
is called E. When we stop, in beginning, in regards to this infinity, this is U. The other extreme is I, the minimal number. With
multidigit numbers, we can move in zone E, starting from uncountable and ending with infinity, the unreachable local limit.

y: when light speed can not be approached, but we can approximate infinitely closer, but the acceleration curve becomes locally
flat. Small letter e is now used - this is the local limit. This limit exists in movement, where the infinity large limit
of Y, the E, stands still: so this is velocity, where we need to keep going, where the acceleration is constant factor, where
even our speeding-up is only a constant position. Locally, in plus/minus, to keep the same acceleration factor, we keep
moving, where our infinity coordinates rather stand still in same acceleration process. So this light is moving in space
as it has the Y as it's reference system approaching, and it's local coordinates rather exist in terms of speed.

As the space has real number relations, the local infinity of light speed and the global infinity of it's accelerated movement
function and it's spatial curvature, which creates a numeric angle.

My numbers from I to E, where U is the middle and V is the exter relation of I and E, octave higher thus forming separate
variable dimension from the one of the local angles: angles between infinity have next frequency, and while they are harmonic,
their ideal follows R=T (the cosinus or conus in my math terms), but their local resonance provides R!=T - they do not fit,
they must resonate and painfully find harmonics, the even or vibrating numbers where they can find the relations, but they
do not do this all the time: incompletness of sound frequencies appears in math, where their idealization converthing time
to spatial axes and making it static is reflected in my word "requency"; in math, the patterns of theorems do not always
appear in the same, synchronized axes, and to get them into resonance, we need to find the conversion patterns as well.
Otherwise we have disintegrated psychological complex we associate to youth and rebellion, a certain age: where in elderly,
we are more in enlightened state and see the complete reality rather than parts, and in childhood we rather have pure
base instincts in complete environment free of trouble, and we are in id: the initial completeness. Youth have to stand
on their own and create something, and they individuate and thus rebel, or do it in metaphor (such as having several
conflicting philosophies or lacking Zen englightenment). While all the young are integral in their settings, and not
all the old are enlightened, in some form of "taste of everything", a balanced reality of longer-term thought; we can
say thay are being this often in principle, to high degree. Most of the youth is removing their instinct, still lacking
any taste, including the taste of one.

# Relativity theory dimensions

Flat conversion into this flatness:
- Angles of numbers are used, they are related to angles in local velocity system as well as global coordinate system
  enclosed to infinite iteration of this velocity and it's accelerations. Infinity is reached, and the local infinity
  has relation to global one. These angles are number angles, and where it becomes flat, an unreachable limit still
  bound in geometry and relation, number E is applied, and from A to E it comes to E zone.
- We see that to get out of box, we have to create something in accelerated space in relation to this infinite space.
- We still measure the bigger space, and infinite has bounds in our relations. Imaginary bounds are bigger than bounds
  of the measurement.
- We linearize this solution in regards to zeroes and infinities in both directions, where acceleration factors appear as
  angles in number space; the limit is approximated from big numbers and angles we maximally know approximate the
  infinity approaching values, leaving us with "ideal" numbers with countable, small number of digits. For this, we
  use multi-letter encoding, such as EA is in E zone, but in it's lower end of direction A. We imagine this repeating
  in fractal in two-dimensional number space, Y dimension is repeating the same single letter up and down, whereas
  X dimension is repeating two letters into left and right; this repetition means that where the numbers are such,
  the other numbers would not easily turn our local number false.

Now in linear dimensions, we add space before our number, and write the more general space coordinates to convert to
accelerated space: the one, where we zoom out our infinity into where acceleration appears linear, using differentation
logic of acceleration similarity. The maximum extent is the local number, where the infinity dimension could be zero or
"U", exactly in the middle point, where ranges above are AE, ranges below are OI, and in V is their outside connection,
of repetition in fractal: in V dimension, the effects already accumulate in new causes, so the effect flows back
into cause in evolution and oscillations such as constructive and destructive vibrations of light, sound, and material
vibrations such as the heat.

We look for infinities in extremes of our variables.

We imagine the space outside infinity, still there by our real numbers, which accelerate themselves into finite measures; 
we write it down as before-space exponents and imponents, such as in O UU and A UU, where the neutral point is either
related as one unit up or down in infinity, in the first possible discern: in our point acceleration logic, it's accelerated
in regards to functions below and above, so two points decide the acceleration-before and acceleration-after of zero. As
our space is curved, this acceleration is meaningful, and applies to prev and next accelerations, providing first v, a
local step for V - it's infinity. v and V relate like light speed and position in our bounded bubble of relativity
horizon.

# Quantum and atom levels

From solid matters to molecules and atoms, again where we go to quants or their internal and shared information units in
time, space and identity tracks of energy and mass: we see the zero is reached, and below it, new dimensions appear;
particularly the element of Space in Five Element Systems - it separates it locally, creating new subspaces. This is
expected as more refined zeroes can be found, opposites of larger infinities; as we divide the number "1" with these
infinities, and call this "octave below" where we project this to division of "1" with "2" - our local point where relative
symmetry of + and * appear, where zero is also kind of ignorant between their various scales, but we change the number
of digits in this zero to make it more or less approximate, and the counts of those digits we can associate with division,
create linearity in our number system to quantum dimensions. We imagine sub-deccelerated spaces and the limit zero,
where shapes leave only relations, kind of only between theorems themselves as static forces, which we also note with numbers
5 to 8 in my math projections of digits and multidimensional digit-number-it's-square-number-of-digits system.

# Here

Mathematically, now we live in space of aligned linearity of dimensions, and the letters are very meaningful. Large digit
positions slowly accumulate, grow in time, while the short-positioned, last digits, reflect the local positions and we
add or remove their value from time, so they fluctuate. This is a way to express it in my digit relations of up-down,
and left-right coordinate systems, and their possible conversions and complex relations of non-uniform symmetries.
