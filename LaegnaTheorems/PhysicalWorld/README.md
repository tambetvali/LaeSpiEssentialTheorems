# 🌌 Laegna Theorems: Physical World

This folder is part of the [LaeSpiEssentialTheorems](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeSpiEssentialTheorems) project. It presents an original and evolving framework that rethinks the **physical world** using Laegna math — an alternative, infinity-consistent logic for modeling **motion, time, space, relativity, and science itself**.

The ideas here connect mathematics with physical theory, natural sciences, and even practice, aiming toward a unified vision of reality that bridges paradoxes and limitations.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Infinity is not an edge case** — it is the foundation.
- **Relativity is reinterpreted** through objects and perspectives, not just equations.
- **Physical systems** can be modeled as expressions of progress, structure, and paradox-resolution.
- **Science practice** is inseparable from how we choose to see, define, and measure.

## ✨ Why It Matters

Physics today faces limitations not only in tools but in its foundational assumptions. Laegna math offers:

- A way to **resolve paradoxes** without collapse
- A bridge between **exact structure** and **interpretive vision**
- A language for **progress, transformation, and deep consistency**
- Insight into **governance, knowledge, and civilization** through physical reasoning
