# Practice of this Mathematical Measurement

I think to gather it all will take quite long.

Measure into separate frequencies the effects, which lose their local shapes when compared to bodies of different scales. The proper frequency metrics is needed to resolve the infinity properties: by this measure, complexity of physics should be reduced, especially in regards to these size-relations and the fact, that those frequential, parallel dimensions or planes do not interact linearly. Mathematical effects of infinities, zeroes and their harmonic or disharmonic frequencies, such as octave symmetry reflection inside octave, in local-scale size.

Search for zero and sub-zero numbers: where continuous matter ends and in more zoom, new-dimensional structures appear, is the minus infinity, the space for smallest topology-coherent infinitesimals, which behave in the same space.

At zero, each point compared to a neighbour has some distance - under zero, it could partially be that a signal needs to travel certain space for the movement to exist into definitely different position in the normal scale.

Into infinity, what's now the most interesting: when speed or position, when you add additional speed or distance, starts to converge into what seems a point inside a space, but behaves like absolute limit value or infinity, then compared to this space outside, this infinity has a relative size.

Speed of light, the velocity-distance relation, should be measured in regards to points moving and not passing certain areas; distortion of infinities inside that speed and at "edges of space" should be compared in regards to being similar distortions. They can be X and Y, or Z and Y scales of the same thing, so this speed, in some measure, in regards to it's point precision, could be Z or X octave in regards to this complete distance in space being Y: a larger scale of the same unit. The fact that small-scale and large-scale infinities meet together comes from properties of space, their coherence, and also the octave relations and harmonic frequencies.

This coherence of local light speed and infinite effect of it comes from coherence of space, for example by bigger local light speed we would see the space infinity being bigger. We want lower and upper bounds and density of this infinity, and then the calculations of space in accelerated, higher space units.
